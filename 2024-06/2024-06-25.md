## custody

Nitro Enclaves provides an isolated compute environment to protect and securely process highly sensitive data such as private keys for blockchain operations. Communication between the EC2 parent instance and the enclave is limited to a secure local vsocks channel.

EC2 instances hosting Nitro Enclaves aren’t publicly accessible and are located in private subnets. EC2 instances have secure internet access via a NAT gateway to download operating system updates and other packages.

Communication with AWS services like AWS KMS or [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)  is kept private via [interface VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html)  that have been placed inside the subnets in each Availability Zone.

The [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)  function shown in this architecture is not required for a production-ready setup.

Also, the provided AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) source just covers the area marked in red. For information about the [Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/)  Ethereum node, refer to [Deploy an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/deploy-an-ethereum-node-on-amazon-managed-blockchain/) .

The following diagram depicts the components deployed inside the EC2 instances and the general communication flow with external AWS services like Secrets Manager or AWS KMS.

이제 enclave가 아니면 kms 키를 조작할 수 없다.
