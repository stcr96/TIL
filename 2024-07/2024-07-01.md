## 비밀키 생성

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout | openssl ec -text -noout > key
```

1. **`openssl ecparam`**:
    - This command is used to manipulate elliptic curve parameters.

2. **`-name secp256k1`**: 
    - Specifies the name of the elliptic curve to use. `secp256k1` is a widely used curve, notably in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

3. **`-genkey`**: 
    - This option generates an EC private key.

4. **`-noout`**: 
    - Prevents the output of the encoded version of the parameters.

5. **`|`**: 
    - This is a pipe that takes the output of the previous command and sends it as input to the next command.

6. **`openssl ec`**: 
    - This command is used to process EC (Elliptic Curve) keys.

7. **`-text`**: 
    - Outputs the key in a human-readable textual format, including both the private and public parts.

8. **`-noout`** (second use): 
    - In this context, it suppresses the output of the encoded form of the key.

9. **`> key`**: 
    - Redirects the output to a file named `key`.

### Summary

- **Step 1**: Generate an EC private key using the `secp256k1` curve.
- **Step 2**: Convert the key into a human-readable format.
- **Step 3**: Save the formatted key to a file named `key`.


```bash
cat key | grep priv -A 3 | tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n[:space:]:' | sed 's/^00//' && echo
```

### Command Breakdown

1. **`cat key`**:
    - Outputs the content of the file `key`.

2. **`| grep priv -A 3`**: 
    - Searches for lines containing "priv" and outputs them along with the following three lines (`-A 3`).

3. **`| tail -n +2`**: 
    - Skips the first line of the output, showing lines from the second onward.

4. **`| tr -d '\n[:space:]:'`**: 
    - Deletes newline characters, spaces, and colons from the output.

5. **`| sed 's/^00//'`**: 
    - Removes leading `00` from the beginning of the string.

6. **`&& echo`**: 
    - Ensures the command ends with a newline for clean output formatting.

### Summary

This command extracts the private key from the file, removes unnecessary characters, and formats it as a continuous hexadecimal string without leading zeros.
